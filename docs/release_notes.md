### Version 1.1

- **Compatibility** - Made the mod compatible with Stonehearth Alpha 10.5.
- **Feature** - The player can now change the role of the hearthling (though the human factions only has one role).


### Version 1.0.4a

- **Technical** - Removed the Jelly requirement.


### Version 1.0.4

- **Bug fix** - Camera no longer jumps back and forth when finishing up customization too quickly.
- **Bug fix** - Customization window no longer flashes when loading up a game.
- **Bug fix** - Camera is working as normal now (no need to open up the Manage Hearthling window).
- **Bug fix** - Saving/Loading during customiziation is working perfectly now, so you can safely save when customizing if you'd want to.
- **Bug fix** - *temporary* Zooming in on hearthlings no longer crashes the game. Though it doesn't behave like I want it to, in that the camera doesn't rotate to face the hearthling. Hopefully, later on, I can figure out a way to bring this back without having the crashes.
