Hearthlings of the Many Faces
===

With this little mod you're able to customize the looks and names of your hearthlings.  
Now you can create an amazon village, make everyone be part of a huge family, create a village full of clones, name the shepherd after yourself, or whatever you come up with!  

### How it works

Whenever you recieve a new hearthling to your kingdom, a new window will show up; where you can edit the hearthling's name, gender, and models.  

### Extra settings

There are some extra options found in *user_settings.json*:  

- **customize embarking**: Enter customization for the hearthlings that are embarking (*true* or *false*).
- **customize immigrating**: Enter customization for the hearthlings that are immigrating (*true* or *false*).
- **zoom to hearthling**: Zoom in to the hearthling (*true* or *false*).
- **pause during customization**: Pause the game while customizing (*true* or *false*).  

### Future implementations

- The camera orbits around the hearthling being customized.
- The camera follows the hearthling during customization.
- Can enter customization for a hearthling later on, maybe through some kind of mage.
- Access to the configurations through the settings screen.  

### Known issues

- The models being used are changed when entering customization (though the gender stays the same at least).  


Apologies for the amount of issues, I'd fix some of them now but I'm stuck with an exam in January and then a thesis. So this will have to do for now, but after that I will continue with this and some other ideas.  

In the meantime, enjoy!
