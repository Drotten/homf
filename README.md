Hearthlings of Many Faces
===

This is a mod for the game Stonehearth. It will allow its players to customize the looks of their citizens, or hearthlings as they're called in game.
Now you can create an amazon village, make everyone be part of a huge family, create a village full of clones, or whatever you feel like!

### How it works

Whenever you recieve a new hearthling to your kingdom, a new window will show up; where you can edit the hearthling's name, gender, and models.

### Extra settings

There are some extra options found in *user_settings.json*:

- **customize embarking**: Enter customization for the hearthlings that are embarking (*true* or *false*).
- **customize immigrating**: Enter customization for the hearthlings that are immigrating (*true* or *false*).
- **zoom to hearthling**: Zoom in to the hearthling (*true* or *false*).
- **pause during customization**: Pause the game while customizing (*true* or *false*).

### Future implementations

- The camera orbits around the hearthling being customized.
- The camera follows the hearthling during customization.
- Can enter customization for a hearthling later on, maybe through some kind of mage.
- Access to the configurations through the settings screen.

### Known issues

- When randomizing, there is a risk of your hearthlings getting baldspots. If that happens, simply change the gender until the problem's gone.


Enjoy!
